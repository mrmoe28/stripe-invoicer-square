# Authentication Fixes - December 2024

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Sign-up Button Navigation Issue
- **Problem**: Sign-up button was not navigating to the sign-up page
- **Root Cause**: LinkButton component was using deprecated `passHref` and `legacyBehavior` props incompatible with Next.js 15 App Router
- **Fix**: Updated `components/ui/link-button.tsx` to use proper App Router syntax
- **Commit**: `b00d42d` - "fix(ui): update LinkButton component for Next.js 15 App Router compatibility"

### 2. Sign-in Authentication Failure
- **Problem**: Existing user could not sign in despite correct credentials
- **Root Cause**: Password hash in database did not match the expected password
- **Fix**: Updated password hash for user `ekosolarize@gmail.com` using bcrypt
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved - User can now sign in successfully

### 3. Environment Variable Parsing Issues
- **Problem**: Environment variables were not being loaded properly
- **Root Cause**: Line breaks in `.env` file were breaking variable parsing
- **Fix**: Cleaned up `.env` file formatting, removed line breaks from Stripe configuration values
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved - All environment variables now load correctly

## Database Status

### Tables Verified
- âœ… `User` - Contains user accounts with proper password hashing
- âœ… `Session` - NextAuth session management
- âœ… `Account` - OAuth provider accounts
- âœ… `Workspace` - User workspaces
- âœ… `Membership` - User-workspace relationships

### Current User
- **Email**: ekosolarize@gmail.com
- **Password**: Chanon28$
- **Workspace**: Ekosolarize Workspace (ekosolarize-workspace)
- **Role**: OWNER

## Testing Results

### Sign-in Test
```
âœ… User found!
âœ… Password is correct!

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth secret key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Public application URL

### Security Notes
- `.env` file is properly ignored by git
